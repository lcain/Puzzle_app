###Project One!

###Welcome to my Dino puzzle!

For Project One I really wanted to get back into Javascript. We went two weeks with barely touching it and focusing mainly on Rails. I knew I had forgotten a lot of the basics of JS. So that's what I did, I decided to do something that would force me to use JS again. 

I found [this](http://www.bestcoloringpagesforkids.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dinosaur-Skeleton-Coloring-Page.jpg) picture and thought it would be perfect for cutting up and turning into a puzzle. 

I started basic with a little four piece puzzle to test with, and then used Gimp to cut up the indiviudal bones.

Here are the libraries used:

Thanks to Jack for teaching me how to do what I wanted to do with this puzzle! There are so many things in this that I've never done before. Thanks to Alex (my other puzzle buddy) for helping me with interact and timer. It was definitely a learning experience the entire week. Next time, I would do it differently.
